# Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute to the project by creating issues or
submitting a pull-request. Please follow standard contributing guidelines, for
instance (non extensive list):

- Check for existing issues before creating a new one
- Check with maintainers before starting to work on an issue or submit a PR in
    order to prevent duplicate work
- Commit messages correspond to the changes

## Mandatory Checks

The changelog is generated based on commit messages and therefore the
[conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style is
enforced. Please ensure that the commit messages are formatted accordingly.

There is a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) file to ensure compliance if
you prefer to use a tool.

## Code Style

The project follows the [ROS2 coding style](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Code-Style-Language-Versions.html).
